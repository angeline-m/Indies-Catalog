# Indies Catalog
CRUD video game catalog made with PHP v.7.3, MySQL, and Bootstrap v4.0 (and a Bootstrap template page).

I've chosen 32 beautiful, unique, and enjoyable games created by independent developers. For the most part, these games are fairly casual and family-friendly. Don't let the games' saccharine theme fool you, some of these games are challenging and thought-provoking!

This repository only exists to show raw code for the project as it is being hosted elsewhere. For security purposes, the `mysql_connect.php` file has not been uploaded.

## Features
* Full CRUD (create, read, update, delete) functionality on all games
* Login and logout to insert, update, or delete entries (redirects on insert/edit pages if not logged in)
* Search functionality with search bar
